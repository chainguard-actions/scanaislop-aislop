## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The composite action step uses `actions/setup-node@v4`, which is pinned to a mutable tag (`v4`) rather than an immutable 40-character commit SHA. A tag can be moved to point to a different (potentially malicious) commit, enabling supply-chain attacks. It should be pinned to a full SHA, e.g. `actions/setup-node@1d0ff469b12f2e6c5a1e9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b # v4`.
