## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The action uses `actions/setup-node@v7`, which is pinned to a mutable version tag rather than an immutable 40-character commit SHA. This means the referenced action could be silently replaced with a different (potentially malicious) version without any change to this file, creating a supply-chain risk.
